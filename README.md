# MonsterMon
 
First VR Unity Project created for CIS400: Intro to Virtual Reality

Made with the Meta Quest 2 in mind. 

## Features
- Enemy Freeroam
- Hand Tracking
- Physics / Collisions

## Goal
Your goal in the game is to walk around the environment, catching the free roaming monsters.  
They can be quite difficult to catch up to so try your best to catch them all as soon as possible.

## Screenshots
Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to a Meta Quest 2 nor did I take any screenshots when I played with one, so I cannot take proper screenshots. Here are some that are from the Unity Editor:
